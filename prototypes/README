Aqsis Prototypes Directory
--------------------------

This directory is a common location for developers to place prototype code
outside the main codebase.  It's meant to be a convenient place to store
code snippets for further discussion and development.

To add a prototype, make a directory with a name reflecting the task at hand,
and add the code there.  Really simple code which is confined to a single file
may also be added here directly.  Some sort of brief documentation should
generally be included - a brief description of the problem and attempted
solution in comments or a readme file.

Useful scripts for dealing with prototype code are also welcome (for instance,
the cppbench script is a benchmark runner tool.)
