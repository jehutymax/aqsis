This directory contains a prototype interface for a new book browser for
piqsl.

For the initial version, the prototype is mainly focussed on providing image
zooming and panning functionality, and providing a possible "look and feel"
for the new interface.

There are a number of shortcuts and commands:

* 'f' toggles the image view between "full window" mode, and having the menus
  etc. visible.
* Scrolling the mousewheel zooms the image
* Pressing the buttons 1 to 9 zooms the image to that multiple of the original
  resolution.
* Dragging the middle mouse button pans the image.


The application needs both boost and fltk to be installed.  See the makefile
for further information.
